        This application is a book information management system.  Books can be directly added from the 'Books' nav item.  Books may also be added via the Google API.  Select the 'Google API' checkbox when performing a search and the API will automatically be searched.  <br/><br/>

        Booklists are maintained via the 'Lists' nav item.  Once Booklists are created, individual books may be added to lists.  Users may create as many Booklists as desired (i.e. "Sunday Afternoon List", "Horror List", "Crime List", etc), and may add as many books as desired into Lists.<br/><br/>
